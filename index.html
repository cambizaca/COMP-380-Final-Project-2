                      <h2>PURPOSE + TIMELINE</h2>
                      <p style="font-size: 15px;"> Over the past 20 years, social media has risen from being nonexistent to being a staple in everyone’s lives. And, with the rise in the popularity of social media also came questions of how much social media giants care about protecting user privacy. It seems that nearly every social media company has been involved in some sort of data privacy scandal, despite the fact that every social media company also claims to have high data security.                             </p>
                      <p style="font-size: 15px;"> So, in order to use social media in the most secure way possible, it is best to have an understanding of how social media companies are using client data and how your data is being used on the internet. If you would like to learn more about the history of social media and its data privacy issues, please see our timeline below.                             </p>

                              <ul>Though the internet had been around since the 1980s, the rise of social media as we know it did not occur until much later. Although it is difficult to pinpoint the exact start of what we now call “social media”, we can look at the creation of MySpace, the first major social media platform, as a start.      </ul>
                              <ul> MySpace allowed users to create those own personal pages and customize it to their liking. It also allowed them to friend other users and interact with their pages, thus bringing in a “social” element to the site.                                    </ul>

                              <ul>Launched in 2003, Facebook started off as a social media network for college students. It steadily grew in popularity until the mid 2000s, from which it skyrocketed in user count. 2006 was a pivotal year in the rise of Facebook because this is when the company extended its membership to anyone above the age of thirteen.                                     </ul>
                              <ul>The website was riddled with privacy issues from the start- as early as 2006, users were complaining about the lack of privacy controls that allowed friends to see any changes made to someone’s profile. But despite these issues, the site still grew exponentially, and the most significant privacy issues were yet to come.                                    </ul>

                              <ul>One of the first times that Facebook’s lack of privacy caught the public eye was in 2007, when Sean Lane sued Facebook for posting private information about users without their approval. Lane noticed this lack of privacy when he tried to purchase a diamond ring from a site called Overstock.com, which was run by Beacon, a Facebook invention. However, after purchasing the ring, the news of his purchase was posted onto his Facebook page without ever asking him or indicating that it was information that could be shared. Although there was an option to hide one’s purchases, this was not the default option and had to be changed by going into one’s settings.                                     </ul>
                              <ul>This case showed that Facebook was using data taken from other sites and storing it internally. It sparked an issue that is still talked about today, which is that social media sites and advertising sites often have a large amount of data flowing between them. Although Facebook’s Beacon program was ended shortly after this lawsuit, it still showed that Facebook was willing to overlook user privacy in order to obtain more data.                                    </ul>

                              <ul> In 2013, it was revealed that Facebook gave sensitive information to Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm. The information that they gave to the firm was personally identifiable and included the results of personality tests, meaning that Cambridge Analytica had access to the personality data of millions of users. The research that Cambridge Analytica did with the personality test data revealed ways that targeted advertisements could be used towards people with different personalities to increase their levels of success. In turn, this could have large-scale impacts on things like elections.                                    </ul>
                              <ul> It should also be noted that the targeted ads that were produced from the Cambridge Analytica findings were not confined to people who had Facebook accounts- even those who did not use Facebook would still be vulnerable, as any site that has a connection to Facebook has an open flow of information with the company. So, users could have in-depth profiles of them be created, resulting in targeting, even if they were not at all involved with Facebook itself.                                    </ul>

                              <ul> The CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) was enacted in 2018, and it outlined numerous productions for users of the internet. It stated that users of websites have a right to know what data is being collected about them, know whether their data is being sold, refuse the sale of their data, access their personal data, request the business to delete their data, and not be discriminated against for doing so.                                     </ul>
                              <ul> Though this act was confined to citizens of California, it marks a landmark piece of legislation as it relates to data privacy, as it enforces more transparency between websites, such as social media platforms, and their consumers regarding what kind of data is being collected.                                    </ul>

                              <ul>Many forms of social media are accessed via phone, which means that moves by phone companies such as Apple can also greatly impact social media companies. One such example was when a 2021 Apple update led to the subsequent loss of nearly ten billion dollars of revenue in social media sites such as Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter.                                    </ul>
                              <ul> Apple’s updated privacy policy required apps to ask users for permission to track their behavior, and with no consequence to the user for opting out. Since many users chose not to have their data collected, social media companies that rely on having user data, whether it be for internal use or to sell to third parties, suffered. This move to increase user privacy again marks a shift towards the right of the consumer to protect their data from social media companies.                                    </ul>
